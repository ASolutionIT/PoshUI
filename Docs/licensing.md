## Why the MIT License?

We chose the MIT license because it is:
- **Commercial Friendly**: You can use PoshUI in your company's internal tools or commercial products.
- **Simple**: No complex legal requirements.
- **Permissive**: You can modify the code to suit your needs.

## Third-Party Libraries

One of the core design principles of PoshUI is **zero third-party dependencies**. 

- No NuGet packages
- No external DLLs (other than standard .NET Framework)
- No third-party UI libraries

This means you don't have to worry about complex licensing chains or supply chain security issues from nested dependencies.
