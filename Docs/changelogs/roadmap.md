# Roadmap

The PoshUI roadmap outlines our future plans for the framework. Our goal is to continue providing IT professionals with the most powerful and easiest-to-use UI framework for PowerShell.

## Q1 2026: Stability & Performance

- **Sequential Refresh Optimizations**: Further reducing overhead in complex dependency chains.
- **Enhanced JSON Validation**: Stronger schema enforcement for Dashboard and Workflow definitions.
- **WPF Rendering Engine Tweaks**: Reducing memory footprint for long-running dashboards.

## Q2 2026: PoshUI.Forms Module

A new module focused on simple, single-page input forms that don't require the step-based navigation of a wizard.
- **Lightweight Templates**: Designed for quick data entry.
- **Layout Control**: More flexible positioning of controls.
- **Direct Submission**: Focused on a single "Submit" action.

## Q3 2026: Notifications & Progress

Two new utility modules to handle common UI tasks outside of full windows.
- **PoshUI.Notifications**: Native Windows toast notifications and custom alert dialogs.
- **PoshUI.Progress**: Standalone progress bars and task runners for scripts that don't need a full wizard UI.

## Q4 2026: Cross-Platform Future (.NET 8)

While this legacy version continues to support .NET Framework 4.8 and PowerShell 5.1, we are actively developing the modern version of PoshUI.
- **PowerShell 7.4+ Support**: Taking full advantage of modern PowerShell features.
- **Cross-Platform Potential**: Exploring options for multi-platform UI support.
- **Native Data Binding**: Deep integration with PowerShell objects.
